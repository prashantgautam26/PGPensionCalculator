# Pension Calculator for Web

This project contains your Pension Calculator, ready to be hosted online using GitHub Pages. Hosting it online is the most secure way to share it and prevent your name from being edited.

## Instructions to Host Your Calculator Online

Follow these steps carefully. This is a one-time setup.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1.  Go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).
2.  Follow the instructions to create a free account. Let's assume your username is `your-username`.

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

1.  Once you are logged into your GitHub account, click the `+` icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
2.  For the **"Repository name"**, enter `PGPensionCalculator`.
3.  Make sure the repository is set to **"Public"**.
4.  Click the **"Create repository"** button.

### Step 3: Upload the Files

1.  In your new repository, you will see a link to **"uploading an existing file"**. Click on it.
2.  You will be taken to a new page. Now, open the `pension-calculator-web` folder on your computer.
3.  Drag and drop the two files (`index.html` and `README.md`) from that folder into the GitHub window in your browser.
4.  Wait for the files to upload, and then click the **"Commit changes"** button.

### Step 4: Activate and Access Your Online Calculator

1.  In your repository, go to the **"Settings"** tab.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **"Pages"**.
3.  Under "Branch", make sure it says `main`, and then click **"Save"**.
4.  It might take a minute or two, but your calculator will be live at:
    `https://your-username.github.io/PGPensionCalculator`
    (Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username).

You can now share this link with anyone.

## How to Update the Calculator

When you need a change, I will provide you with an updated `index.html` file. Here’s how to update the live calculator:

1.  Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/your-username/PGPensionCalculator`
2.  Above the list of files, on the right, click the **"Add file"** button and then select **"Upload files"**.
3.  This will take you to the upload page. You can now drag the new `index.html` file I gave you directly into this window.
4.  It will replace the old file.
5.  Click the **"Commit changes"** button.

Your calculator will be updated at the same link within a minute or two.
